# Background Removal Tool

This repo provides a small script to remove the background in an image using Python. The script utilizes the `rembg` library for background removal and `PIL` (now Pillow) for image handling.

The `p_remove_bg.py` script allows you to give an image file and remove its background, saving the result as `output.png` in the project folder.
